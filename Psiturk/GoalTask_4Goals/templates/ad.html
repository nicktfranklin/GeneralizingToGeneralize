<!--
	The ad.html has a very specific format.

	Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.

	The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
	the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
	your hit.

	The second part of the ad display after the person selected
	"Accept HIT" on the Amazon website.  This will reload the
	ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
	open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
	server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).

	See comments throughout for hints

									The Frank Lab at Brown University is looking for online participants between the
									ages of 18 and 40 for a psychology experiment. Please note that this task will take
									your full concentration. <strong> This is a <i>long</i> task </strong>. The task will typically
									take 20-25 minutes to complete and will pay $2.00. This HIT requires your full attention
									and you will have up to one hour to complete the HIT, after which you will not be able to submit.
                  </p>

                  <p>
									There will be many opportunities to earn bonus payments. Performing well on the task
									can increase your total earning by up to an additional $1.84, with good performance
									typically earning around $1.25-$1.50
							    </p>
                  <p>
                      Please not that this HIT uses color extensively and requires a standard US keyboard.
                      If you are unable to distinguish between colors or do not have a standard keyboard,
                      please do not accept this HIT.
                  </p>
							    <div class="alert alert-danger">
									<strong>This task can only be completed once.</strong> <br/>
									If you have already completed this task before the system will not allow you to run
                                    again. If this looks familiar please return the HIT so someone else can participate.

								    Otherwise, please click the "Accept HIT" button on the Amazon site above to begin the task.

									It is important you do not change the code for the
									openwindow() function below if you want you experiment
